# Observations

## Random Move Choice

  + After 500,000 games of random vs random the following outcome proportions were achieved:
    * Player One Victory:       0.3833
    * Player Two Victory:       0.3594
    * Stalemate:                0.2573

    This took ~33 minutes to run

    Some modifications to the code, somehow seemed to change the balance of the game.
    After these changes the following outcome proportions were achieved (1,000,000 games):

    * Player One Victory:       0.5556
    * Player Two Victory:       0.4417
    * Stalemate:                0.0026

    This took ~10 minutes to run
